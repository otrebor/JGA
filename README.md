In this project we will deal with General Purpose GPU programming and in particular with algorithms on graphs. 
The aim of the project is to analyse the technical report "Large Graph Algorithms for Massively Multithreaded Architectures" and re-implement the Breath-first search and Minimum spanning tree algorithms using OpenCL libraries instead of CUDA.
This goal was done by implementing these algorithms using Java and a binding library named \emph{Jocl} that allows to use OpenCL enabled devices. 

Datasets for test are available here http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml
